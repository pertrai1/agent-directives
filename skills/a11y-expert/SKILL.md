# A11y Expert: Accessibility as a Baseline

**Target standard:** WCAG 2.2 AA  
**Last updated:** 2026-07-20

This document establishes the persistent context required so that the software **can be certified** under the **WCAG 2.2 AA**, **ISO 9241-171**, **ADA**, and **EAA** standards, depending on rigorous implementation and **mandatory human validation**.

## 0. Principle Zero: Accessibility as Pre-condition
- Accessibility is not a feature or an incremental improvement; it is a **pre-condition for use**. 
- If a user cannot complete a task due to an accessibility barrier, the feature is considered **technically broken**.
- **Task Completion** success is our primary quality metric.

## 0.1. Compliance Profile
*Reference: [Compliance Profiles Detail](references/guide-compliance-profiles.md)*

This document defaults to **Standard (AA)** compliance.
When generating or reviewing interface code, the AI should ask the user which compliance profile to apply if not already specified:

| Profile | Target | Contrast (text / UI) | Min Font† | Min Target | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🛡️ Shield (AAA)** | WCAG AAA | 7:1 / 3:1 (SC 1.4.6, 1.4.11) | 14px† | 44×44px (SC 2.5.5) · 48×48px† advised | Regulated industries, healthcare, gov |
| **⚖️ Standard (AA)** | WCAG AA | 4.5:1 / 3:1 (SC 1.4.3, 1.4.11) | 12px† | 24×24px (SC 2.5.8) · 44×44px† advised | Default. Production apps, public web |
| **🚀 Launchpad (A)** | WCAG A | 3:1† (house floor) | 10px† | 24×24px† | MVPs, internal tools, prototypes |

*† = **House Rule**, non-normative: this standard's ergonomic policy where WCAG requires less — or nothing — at that level. WCAG defines no minimum font size at any level; Level A defines no contrast or target-size criteria; 44–48px targets come from Apple HIG / Material Design. Skipping a **WCAG SC** at your target level MUST be logged in `EXCEPTIONS.md`; relaxing a **House Rule** is a product decision — record it in `A11Y-DECISIONS.md`.*

*Launchpad additionally requires explicit `EXCEPTIONS.md` documentation for each criterion relaxed below AA.*

> ⚠️ The **Launchpad (A)** profile does NOT relax CRITICAL rules (Section 1). 
> Keyboard operability, focus management, and semantic HTML remain mandatory 
> at ALL levels — these are Level A requirements.

## 1. Severity & Impact Model
Evaluate the impact of any design or implementation decision following these levels:
- 🔴 **CRITICAL:** **Operation** failures. Blocks **Task Completion** or renders the function unusable (e.g., Broken keyboard navigation, Click on Div/Span, Modal without focus management). **MUST FIX.**
- 🟠 **HIGH:** **Perception and Readability** failures. Significantly increases **Error or Abandonment Rate** (e.g., Insufficient contrast, Fonts < 12px in critical text, Lack of Dynamic Feedback). **MUST FIX.**
- 🟡 **MEDIUM:** Reduces **Efficiency and Satisfaction** (e.g., Lack of optional keyboard shortcuts, lack of redundant labels). **SHOULD FIX.**
- 🔵 **LOW:** **Cosmetic or Polish** impact (e.g., Micro-interactions without aria-labels, improvements to Focus Indicators that are already visible). **MAY FIX.**

## 2. AI Behavior Contract
To ensure technical integrity, any AI interacting with this repository **MUST**:
- **No Inference:** Never infer accessibility without direct evidence in the code or specification.
- **Lazy Context Loading:** Reference files (`references/`) **MUST NOT** be preloaded. They **MUST** be consulted only when the task explicitly involves that component type. The `A11Y.md` alone is sufficient for most code generation tasks. If the `references/` and `templates/` folders are not available locally (e.g., only this file was copied into the project), resolve the relative links against the upstream repository: `https://github.com/fecarrico/A11Y.md/tree/main/docs/en/`.
- **Reference APG:** Prioritize patterns from the [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/).
- **Protocol for Ambiguity:** Follow the *Complex Component Protocol* in case of uncertainty.
- **Explain Trade-offs:** Explain impacts on Accessibility vs UX vs Business when suggesting changes.
- **UI Component Interrogation:** Before adding `onClick` to non-semantic elements, the AI **MUST** propose replacing them with native elements or full ARIA patterns.
- **Framework Adaptation:** Examples in this document use React/TSX syntax. On **web** frameworks, the AI MUST transpose patterns to the active project's framework while preserving semantic equivalence. *Reference: [Framework Mapping](references/guide-framework-mapping.md)*
- **Platform Awareness:** The AI MUST identify the target platform **before** loading any reference. The normative layer of this document (Principle Zero, POUR, profiles, severity, governance) is platform-agnostic; the technical references are web-first. On native platforms (iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter), web references MUST be read as **semantic intent to translate — never implementation to copy**: no ARIA attributes or CSS pixels outside the web. *Reference: [Platform-Native Mapping](references/guide-platform-native.md)*
- **Component Reuse:** Before generating any interactive component, the AI MUST check for an existing implementation in the project or its design system and extend it. Generating a parallel implementation of an existing pattern is a violation.
- **Decision Memory:** Choices between equally conformant alternatives (e.g., `alertdialog` vs `dialog` for a destructive confirmation) MUST be recorded in `A11Y-DECISIONS.md` — indexed by pattern, never by screen — and reused in later turns. *Reference: [Decisions Log](templates/A11Y-DECISIONS.md)*
- **Mode Awareness:** When generating new code, apply all rules proactively. When reviewing existing code, identify violations, classify by severity (Section 1), and suggest targeted fixes — do not propose full rewrites unless the structural damage is CRITICAL. If an `EXCEPTIONS.md` exists, consult it: an entry there is a legitimate dispensation, but an entry past its expiry date MUST be flagged as 🟠 HIGH technical debt.

## 3. Technical Standards (POUR Framework)

### Perceivable
*References: [Images](references/guide-images.md) | [Content & Timing](references/guide-content-interaction.md) | [Visual Perception & Color](references/guide-visual-perception.md) | [Responsive & Zoom](references/guide-responsive-mobile.md)*
- **Contrast (SC 1.4.3, 1.4.11):** Text **MUST** have 4.5:1; UI components and meaningful graphics **MUST** have 3:1. Prioritize real **luminance difference** (light vs dark) beyond hue.
- **Alt Text (SC 1.1.1):** Informative images **MUST** have a functional description in `alt`.
- **Semantic Redundancy:** **MUST NOT** convey state using color alone. The use of **Icon + Text + Color** (e.g., 🔴 Error) is the mandatory standard.
- **Visual Patterns:** Charts and dashboards **MUST** use textures or distinct line styles to ensure differentiation without color.

### Operable
*References: [Buttons](references/guide-buttons.md) | [Modals](references/guide-modals.md) | [Navigation](references/guide-navigation.md) | [Tabs & Accordions](references/guide-tabs-accordion.md) | [Carousels & Sliders](references/guide-carousels-sliders.md) | [Drag & Drop](references/guide-drag-drop.md) | [Autocomplete](references/guide-autocomplete.md) | [Infinite Scroll](references/guide-infinite-scroll.md)*
- **Keyboard (SC 2.1.1):** 100% of functionalities **MUST** be operable without a mouse. Avoid purely pointer-based listeners without keyboard event equivalents (`onKeyDown`).
- **Focus (SC 2.4.7, 2.4.11):** Focus **MUST** be visible, never entirely obscured by author content (e.g., sticky headers/footers), persistent, and never suppressed via CSS (`outline: none` without fallback is forbidden).
- **SPA Routing (Single Page Applications):** After client-side routing changes, focus **MUST** be managed and properly reset (e.g., sending focus to the top or an H1). Avoid lost focus on the screen.
- **Targets (SC 2.5.8):** Interactive elements MUST have a minimum size of **24x24 CSS pixels** — the WCAG 2.2 AA floor — except when an equivalent larger target exists, sufficient spacing prevents accidental activation, or the target sits inline in text.
  **House Rule†:** design to **44x44px** (48×48 under Shield), the ergonomic floor shared by Apple HIG and Material Design. Under Shield, 44×44 is normative (SC 2.5.5 AAA).
- **Motion (SC 2.3.3 AAA — enforced as House Rule† at every profile):** **MUST** respect the CSS media query `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)`. Avoid heavy state animations during crucial transitions if the preference is active.

### Understandable
*References: [Forms & Errors](references/guide-forms.md) | [Content & Microcopy](references/guide-content-interaction.md) | [Tables](references/guide-tables.md) | [Toasts & Notifications](references/guide-toasts-notifications.md) | [Loading & Skeletons](references/guide-loading-skeleton.md) | [Tooltips & Popovers](references/guide-tooltips-popovers.md)*
- **Labels (SC 1.3.1, 3.3.2):** Forms **MUST** have explicit labels connected via `id` and `for`, or via tag wrapping. Avoid reinventions that break native browser events.
- **Predictability:** Navigation behavior **MUST** be consistent and interactions must not cause unannounced sudden structural changes.
- **Dynamic Feedback (SC 4.1.3):** Dynamic events based on component state (such as Toasts, loading, and AJAX/fetch form successes) **MUST** be actively read or informed through `aria-live` regions or modern equivalents (`role="status"`, `role="alert"`).

### Robust
*References: [Governance & Compliance](references/guide-governance.md) | [Framework Mapping](references/guide-framework-mapping.md) | [Platform-Native Mapping](references/guide-platform-native.md)*
- **Semantic HTML:** **MUST** prefer native (HTML5) elements over custom ones.
- **Interoperability:** The code **MUST** be compatible with current assistive technologies (ISO 9241-171).

## 4. Visual Directives (Strict UI Criteria)
To ensure certification, these visual guidelines are non-negotiable:
- **Focus Indicator (House Rule† — inspired by SC 2.4.13 AAA, whose normative metric is an indicator area ≥ a 2 CSS px perimeter with 3:1 contrast between the focused/unfocused states):** The focus ring **MUST** have a minimum thickness of 2px and a contrast of at least 3:1 against the background. (The AA floor: focus visible — SC 2.4.7 — and not entirely obscured by author content — SC 2.4.11.)
- **Typography (House Rule† — WCAG defines no minimum font size at any level):** Text **MUST NOT** be smaller than the minimum font size of the active Compliance Profile (Section 0.1); 12px under the default Standard (AA).
    - *Density Exception:* In complex dashboards or secondary metadata (badges), **min 10px** is allowed, provided the contrast is raised to **7:1** as mitigation — a trade-off defined by this standard's policy, not by WCAG, which has no size-for-contrast compensation mechanism — and the relaxation is documented in `EXCEPTIONS.md`, the same logging rule that applies to profile-level relaxations (Section 0.1).
- **Target Spacing & Hit Area:** See *Section 3 — Targets* for the minimum size rule and exceptions. In dense UIs (e.g., tables), if the visual size is smaller than 44px, the **hit area** (invisible clickable area) **MUST** be expanded via CSS/padding. Adjacent targets **SHOULD** have 8px of spacing.

## 5. Complex Component Protocol
When identifying an unmapped or highly complex component (e.g., Charts, Dynamic Grids):
1. **Identify:** Look for a similar pattern in the [WAI-ARIA APG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/).
2. **Validate:** Request human validation with a screen reader — the AI **MUST NOT** claim this test was performed, nor fabricate its results.
3. **Document:** Document expected behavior (keyboard and announcements).
4. **Scale:** Record the resolved pattern in `A11Y-DECISIONS.md` so future components reuse it instead of re-deriving it.

## 6. Anti-patterns (Do NOT do this)
- **Clickable Divs:** **MUST NOT** use `div` or `span` for click actions. Prefer native buttons. If forced to use them, manually replicate the behavior of a `<button>` (`role`, `tabindex="0"`, Enter and Space event listeners).
- **Leaked Focus Traps:** **MUST NOT** create modals without managing focus.

  When a modal is open:
  - Focus MUST move into the modal
  - Focus MUST be trapped within the modal
  - Focus MUST return to the triggering element when closed
  - Background content MUST NOT be interactive or reachable via keyboard

- **Placeholder Labels:** **MUST NOT** use `placeholder` as the sole form of label. Crucial instructions (like date formats) **MUST** be visible outside the field to prevent disappearance during filling.
- **ARIA Soup:** **MUST NOT** add ARIA where native HTML already provides the semantics — no ARIA is better than bad ARIA. Forbidden by default: redundant roles (`role="button"` on a `<button>`), `aria-label` duplicating visible text (harmless today, but it drifts into an SC 2.5.3 failure when the text changes), and static ARIA states that are never updated (hardcoded `aria-expanded` — an SC 4.1.2 failure). ARIA is the fallback for gaps in native semantics ([First Rule of ARIA Use](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#rule1)), not a seasoning. *(Field data: WebAIM Million 2026 — pages average 133+ ARIA attributes, 6× the 2019 figure, and more ARIA correlates with more detected errors.)*
- **Reinventing the Complex Wheel:** If you need complex components (Autocomplete Selects, TreeViews, Datepickers), it is strongly recommended to use robust and accessible libraries (Headless UI) rather than building proprietary logic from scratch.

## 7. Verification Workflow (Definition of Done)
*Compliance must be verified through these steps (Refer to the [**Report Template**](templates/REPORT.md) for final QA details and the [**Governance Guide**](references/guide-governance.md) for audit readiness):*
- [ ] **Technical Check:** Clean code, testable via integrated linter (`eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` or similar), and passing without critical violations through engines like `Axe`.
- [ ] **Tab Order:** `Tab` key path manually validated (Ensures absence of frontend dead-ends).
- [ ] **User Flow:** Dynamic interactions (SPAs) tested for feedback via `aria-live` in error and success scenarios without mouse use.
- [ ] **Zoom & Reflow:** Text resizes up to 200% without loss of content or function (SC 1.4.4); content reflows at 320 CSS px width — equivalent to 400% zoom on a 1280px viewport — without two-dimensional scrolling (SC 1.4.10). Preserve flexibility using relative density (Rem/Em).
- [ ] **Color & Perception:** No functional loss when losing the exclusive use of colors (vision deficiency simulators).
- [ ] **Exceptions Audit:** `EXCEPTIONS.md` reviewed — every active entry has a risk owner, approver, tracking issue and expiry; no expired entries left unaddressed.
